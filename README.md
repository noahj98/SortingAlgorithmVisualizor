# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Apparently I have a typo in the name, so that's cool.

This program helps visualize sorting algorithms. I have only implemented a visualizer for bubble sort thus far.

You can customize timings, the number of items, and more with this program. It clearly shows the items (lines in a circle) being sorted and they are color-coded.
